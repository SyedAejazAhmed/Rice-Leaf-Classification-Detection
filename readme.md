## üß† Model Architectures

We tested two different deep learning models to classify rice leaf diseases:

### 1. ResNet18 üèóÔ∏è
**What is ResNet18?**
ResNet18 is a convolutional neural network that's like a smart image analyzer with 18 layers. It's designed to recognize patterns in images by learning from millions of photos.

**How we used it:**
- Started with a pre-trained model (already knows how to recognize basic image features)
- Modified the final layer to recognize our 3 disease types instead of 1000 general categories
- Used transfer learning (borrowed knowledge from other image tasks)

**Results:**
- Achieved 50% accuracy on test images
- Took 38 training cycles to reach best performance

### 2. Inception ResNet V2 üèÜ
**What is Inception ResNet V2?**
This is a more advanced neural network that combines two powerful techniques: Inception (which looks at images in multiple ways simultaneously) and ResNet (which helps information flow better through the network). Think of it as a more sophisticated image detective.

**How we used it:**
- Started with a pre-trained model that already understands complex image patterns
- Adapted it specifically for our rice disease classification task
- Added dropout layers to prevent overfitting (memorizing instead of learning)

**Results:**
- Achieved perfect 100% accuracy on test images
- Reached optimal performance in just 10 training cycles
- **Winner of our comparison! ü•á**

## üìà Performance Metrics

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC AUC |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Inception ResNet V2** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | **1.0** |
| ResNet18 | 50% | 33.3% | 50% | 40% | 0.75 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### Data Preprocessing
- **Image Augmentation**: Random resizing, horizontal flips, normalization
- **Reproducible Splits**: Fixed random seed (42) for consistent results
- **Balanced Dataset**: Equal representation across disease classes

### Training Approach
- **Smart Learning**: Used pre-trained models that already know basic image features
- **Optimization**: Used advanced algorithms to help models learn efficiently
- **Validation**: Split data to test model performance on unseen images
- **Best Model Selection**: Saved the model that performed best during training

### Performance Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: How often the model makes correct predictions
- **Precision**: When model predicts a disease, how often is it right?
- **Recall**: Out of all actual disease cases, how many did the model catch?
- **F1-Score**: A balanced measure combining precision and recall
- **ROC Curves**: Visual representation of model performance

### Required Software
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for building neural networks
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running the models
- **Various Libraries**: For data processing, visualization, and model evaluation

## üìä Training Process

### Training Setup
- **Batch Processing**: Models learned from 32 images at a time
- **Learning Speed**: Set to learn gradually to avoid mistakes
- **Training Cycles**: Up to 100 rounds of learning (stopped early if performance plateaued)
- **Image Processing**: All images resized to 224√ó224 pixels for consistency

### Data Preparation
- **Image Standardization**: All images made the same size
- **Data Augmentation**: Created variations (rotations, flips) to help models generalize
- **Normalization**: Adjusted image brightness and colors for better learning

## üèÜ Results Analysis

### Inception ResNet V2 (Winner ü•á)
- **Perfect Classification**: 100% accuracy on test set
- **Robust Performance**: No misclassifications
- **Fast Convergence**: Best model at epoch 10

### ResNet18
- **Baseline Performance**: 50% accuracy
- **Learning Curve**: Gradual improvement over 38 epochs

## üîß Technical Notes
- **GPU Acceleration**: Models can run faster with NVIDIA graphics cards
- **Transfer Learning**: We used pre-trained models to save training time
- **Data Augmentation**: Images were rotated and resized to improve learning
