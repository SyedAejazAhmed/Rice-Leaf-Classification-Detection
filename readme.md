## üß† Model Architectures

We tested three different deep learning models to classify rice leaf diseases:

### 1. ResNet18 üèóÔ∏è
**What is ResNet18?**
ResNet18 is a convolutional neural network that's like a smart image analyzer with 18 layers. It's designed to recognize patterns in images by learning from millions of photos.

**How we used it:**
- Started with a pre-trained model (already knows how to recognize basic image features)
- Modified the final layer to recognize our 3 disease types instead of 1000 general categories
- Used transfer learning (borrowed knowledge from other image tasks)

**Results:**
- Achieved 50% accuracy on test images
- Took 38 training cycles to reach best performance

### 2. VGG19 üîç
**What is VGG19?**
VGG19 is a deep convolutional neural network with 19 layers that's known for its simplicity and effectiveness. It uses small 3√ó3 filters throughout the network, making it excellent at capturing fine details in images. Think of it as a meticulous detective that examines every small detail.

**How we used it:**
- Started with a pre-trained VGG19 model (trained on millions of images)
- Froze the feature extraction layers to preserve learned patterns
- Modified the classifier to output 3 disease categories instead of 1000
- Added dropout layers to prevent overfitting

**Results:**
- Training in progress...
- Expected to perform well on detailed image analysis

### 3. Inception ResNet V2 üèÜ
**What is Inception ResNet V2?**
This is a more advanced neural network that combines two powerful techniques: Inception (which looks at images in multiple ways simultaneously) and ResNet (which helps information flow better through the network). Think of it as a more sophisticated image detective.

**How we used it:**
- Started with a pre-trained model that already understands complex image patterns
- Adapted it specifically for our rice disease classification task
- Added dropout layers to prevent overfitting (memorizing instead of learning)

**Results:**
- Achieved perfect 100% accuracy on test images
- Reached optimal performance in just 10 training cycles
- **Winner of our comparison! ü•á**
